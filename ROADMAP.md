# Roadmap for Microtransaction Insights

This roadmap reflects a commitment to continuously evolving the platform to improve performance, scalability, and user experience. Each phase builds on the work already completed—transforming a school project into a modern, production-ready application that leverages cutting-edge technologies.

## Short-Term Goals (Q2 2025)

- **Enhanced Testing & Data Simulation**
  - Expand synthetic data generation using Faker.js to simulate diverse, real-world scenarios.
  - Increase unit and integration testing coverage using Jest.

- **Analytics & Reporting Enhancements**
  - Develop advanced report generation features to uncover peak transaction periods and key performance metrics.
  - Implement data caching strategies to improve response times and reduce database load.

- **Backend Migration & API Improvements**
  - Transition from Google Cloud Run container to serverless functions (either AWS Lambda or Azure Functions)
  - Refactor API endpoints using an MVC structure and Adapter pattern (especially for Azure Functions integration) to streamline deployments.
  
- **Security & Cost-Optimization**
  - Introduce robust user authentication and permission systems for enhanced data security.
  - Integrate rate limiting and function throttling to safeguard against repeated serverless function calls—saving on operational costs.
  - Add API documentation

- **Frontend Refinements**
  - Optimize the React.js (Vite) frontend interface for dynamic, responsive user experiences, ensuring seamless integration with backend services.

## Long-Term Goals

- **Advanced Analytics & Machine Learning**
  - Incorporate geolocation data and text prediction for enhanced address standardization and nuanced analytics.
  <!-- - Explore predictive analytics to drive advanced reporting capabilities and deeper business insights. -->

- **Database Scalability and Migration**
  - Evaluate a potential migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL to support more complex relational queries and further improve performance, while continuing to use Azure Database for production.

- **Unified Serverless Architecture & CI/CD**
  - Build a fully unified serverless backend that minimizes redundancies and simplifies code reuse.
  - Establish comprehensive CI/CD pipelines combined with advanced monitoring to accelerate development cycles and ensure reliability.

- **User Experience & Design Overhaul**
  - Enhance the frontend UI with modern frameworks (such as Tailwind CSS) for a more attractive and user-friendly experience.
  - Continue refining performance through server-side optimizations and enhanced caching strategies.

This evolving roadmap underlines my commitment to modernizing the platform—from leveraging containerization through Docker and deploying with Azure Static Web Apps to embracing best practices in security, performance, and scalability. As new technologies emerge and user feedback drives further refinement, I'll keep updating this roadmap to guide MicroTrack towards a more robust future.
