# ROADMAP.ME
Long-term tasks and features to implement

### (Current at top)
- Convert to TypeScript
- Convert backend (js to ts, and handlebars to standard API) as development backend
- Create severless production backend. Share and write modular code so there is little repetitive refactoring between frontend and backend
- Create basic React frontend approximating previous app in flow
- Add Tailwind, beautify app with CSS
- Add function limiting transactions (and functions fired) for x amount of seconds (to save costs, in case a code error causes repeat mistaken serverless function calls)
- Add geolocation and text-prediction for addresses
