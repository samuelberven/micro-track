# 🚀 Microtransaction Insights - Tracking and Analysis Platform

## 🎯 Project Overview
**MicroTrack** is a robust platform that enables gaming companies to track, analyze, and optimize in-game microtransactions. By leveraging real-time tracking and deep analytics, decision makers can identify trends, maximize revenue, and fine-tune business strategies across multiple titles. **Note:**: As explained below, I am rewriting the entire app and moving it to the cloud. You may be seeing it in a non-finished form.

## 🔄 Project Evolution

**🏗️ Original Version:**  
This project began as a team Node.js application built with Handlebars templating. It connected directly via SSH to a MySQL database hosted on our school server, serving as a class assignment to illustrate basic server-side development and database interactions.

**🚀Motivation for Improvement:**  
The original implementation, while functional for educational purposes, had several limitations—most notably in scalability, maintainability, and security. Recognizing these constraints, I decided to modernize the project to align with industry best practices, and improve my understanding of TypeScript and various cloud services.

**🔧Professional Rework:**  
The project is being re-engineered using up-to-date technologies and methods:
- **🖥️Frontend:** Transitioned to React.js (Vite) to offer a dynamic, responsive interface. Deployed via Azure Static Web Apps.
- **⚙️Backend:** Redesigned using Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, following an MVC architecture. Currently being deployed via a Google Cloud Run container.
- **🗄️Database:** Implemented a Dockerized MySQL environment for local development, with Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server for production deployments.
- **📦Containerization & Deployment:** Leveraged Docker and Azure Static Web Apps for streamlined deployment and scalability.
<!-- - **Testing:** Introduced comprehensive testing with Jest and realistic data generation via [faker](https://fakerjs.dev/). -->

**📈Impact:**  
This transformation improved the application's scalability, security, and maintainability. It also allowed me to deepen my expertise in modern development practices, demonstrating my capacity to evolve and enhance existing systems.

## 🔑Key Features
- **🎮Multi-Game & Multi-Developer Support:** Manage microtransactions across various titles and teams.
- **💰Comprehensive Transaction Tracking:** Monitor every detail—from amounts and dates to game-specific data.
<!-- - **Robust Analytics & Reporting:** Generate insights on peak periods, revenue differences, and performance metrics. -->
- **📊Analytics & Reporting Support:** Generate data helping create insights on peak periods, revenue differences, and performance metrics.
<!-- - **Rigorous Testing:** Implement thorough unit and integration tests using **Jest** and synthetic data via [faker](https://fakerjs.dev/). -->
- **🗄️Flexible Data Management:** Use a relational MySQL database (local/Azure) to manage complex data relationships.

## 🛠️Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js (Vite), Azure Static Web Apps
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Google Cloud Run
- **Database:** MySQL (Dockerized for local development & deployed via Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server)
<!-- - **Testing:** Jest & Faker.js -->
- **Containerization & Deployment:** Docker, Azure Static Web Apps

## 🏗️Architecture
The project adheres to the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern:
- **🗄️Model:** Defines the schema for games, developers, transactions, and customers.
- **🖥️View:** A responsive React interface for interactive data visualization.
- **⚙️Controller:** API endpoints handling CRUD operations and business logic.
> **Note:** The backend uses the adapter pattern to seamlessly switch between local Dockerized MySQL and Azure deployments.

## ⚙️Installation Instructions

### 🔧General Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samuelberven/micro-stack.git
    cd micro-stack
  ```
2. **🗄️Database Setup (Local Development)**
- Using Dockerized MySQL: The docker-compose.yml file configures MySQL along with initialization scripts.
Ensure Docker is running.
Start the MySQL service with:
  ```bash
    docker-compose up db
  # Update the .env file with your own MySQL credentials.
  ```

3. **⚙️Backend Setup**
- Navigate to the backend directory:
  ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
- Compile and run:
  ```bash
    npx tsc
    node dist/index.js
  ```
- Run tests:
  ```bash
    npm run test
  ```
4. **🖥️Frontend Setup**
- Navigate to the frontend directory:
  ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
  ```
- Start the development server:
  ```bash
    npm run dev
  ```
- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
<!-- 5. - Run tests:
  ```bash
    npm run test
  ``` -->

5. **🔍API Testing with Postman**
For easier API exploration and testing, import the provided Postman collection:
- 📥Importing the Collection:
  - Open Postman and click on Import.
  - Navigate to /server/postman/
  - Select all 7 postman_collection.json files from that directory
